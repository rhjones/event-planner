[Happening API](https://github.com/rhjones/happening-api) on GitHub

Put your event plans into digital action with Happening, an event invitation app to help you manage your event-related correspondence with ease. Create your own digital invitations for any type of event you're planning and watch the RSVPs roll in.
Users can create events and browse/RSVP to other users' events.

Happening was originally built in collaboration with [@jaimegaribaldo7](https://github.com/JaimeGaribaldo7) and [@styletabtech](https://github.com/styletabtech). **For notes on the development process, see [my blog post](http://rebekahheacock.org/2016/11/general-assembly-wdi-week-9/).**
